This project implements a longest common subsequence algorithm. This algorithm is for comparing two different sequences of characters, of any length, and finding the longest common subsequence from both strings, through using dynamic programming. Here, the "bottom-up" solution is used for printing the resulting subsequence. Involved are two arrays: one that represents the subsequence length at different subproblem lengths, and one that represents the arrows for directing the program which characters to print and which direction to recursively go through the printing function. The program accepts user input for the strings. Throughout the program are some comments that , when implemented, serve as testing code for making sure the algorithm is running correctly. Other comments just explain different stages of the program.
